# Multi-Agent System Issues Resolution Summary

## Issues Addressed

### Issue 1: Missing test_results.csv ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: The `test_results.csv` file was missing, which is required for evaluating the multi-agent system.

**Solution**: 
1. Fixed a bug in `project_starter.py` where `init_database()` was called without the required `db_engine` parameter
2. Ran the multi-agent system to process all 20 requests from `quote_requests_sample.csv`
3. Generated `test_results.csv` with complete evaluation results

**Files Created/Modified**:
- Fixed `project_starter.py` (line 710)
- Generated `test_results.csv` (3.3KB, 22 lines)

**Verification**: The file now contains all required data:
- At least 3 requests resulting in cash balance changes ✅
- At least 3 quote requests successfully fulfilled ✅
- Not all requests fulfilled, with reasons provided ✅

### Issue 2: No transparent customer-facing outputs ✅ RESOLVED
**Problem**: The system was generating internal technical outputs instead of transparent, explainable customer-facing responses.

**Solution**:
1. Created a comprehensive customer output generation system
2. Transformed internal technical responses into professional customer-facing outputs
3. Ensured all requirements for transparency and explainability are met

**Files Created**:
- `customer_outputs.py` (13KB) - Customer output generator module
- `generate_customer_outputs.py` (3.4KB) - Script to generate outputs
- `customer_outputs.csv` (12KB) - Customer-facing responses for all 20 requests
- `customer_outputs_summary.txt` (2.6KB) - Summary report
- `customer_outputs_verification.md` (5.4KB) - Detailed verification document

## Customer Outputs Compliance
